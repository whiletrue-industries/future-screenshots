The blog post "Future Screenshots: Methodological Notes for a Political Imagination Workshop" introduces an innovative workshop methodology aimed at stimulating political imagination by creating speculative "future screenshots." These screenshots are conceptual exercises where participants envision how digital interfaces—such as social media posts, chat conversations, AI interactions, and notifications—might look in different possible futures. By designing these imagined digital artifacts, the workshop participants explore the ways in which technological, political, and social changes might manifest in everyday interactions, encouraging a deeper engagement with potential societal shifts.

Through this method, the workshop acts as a structured framework for discussing alternative futures in a tangible and relatable way. Rather than relying on abstract discussions about what the future might hold, participants are asked to generate concrete representations of digital experiences that reflect different future scenarios. The screenshots serve as storytelling tools that articulate anxieties, hopes, and critical reflections on emerging trends, allowing for a more participatory and accessible approach to political foresight and speculative design.

Participants are provided with a few distinct paper templates resembling mobile phone screens, each prompting them to envision and document different aspects of potential futures:​
1. Social Media Post: Encourages participants to craft a monologue-style post reflecting what someone might share in a future scenario.​
2. Chat Conversation: Invites the creation of dialogues between individuals in a future context, exploring their interactions and relationships.​
3. Notification Alert: Focuses on the types of alerts or notifications one might receive, such as news headlines or app updates, in a future setting.​
4. AI Agent Query: Prompts participants to consider the questions they might pose to an AI assistant in the future, highlighting human concerns and curiosities.​
5. Map Visualization: Tasks participants with illustrating a map of the region in a future scenario, emphasizing significant geographical or political changes.​
6. Photograph: Encourages sketching or describing a photo capturing a moment or scene from a envisioned future.​
7. Review: Asks participants to write a review of a product, service, or experience in the future, reflecting on its impact and significance.​
8. Sign in a demonstration: Prompts the creation of a sign that communicates a message or warning in a future context, emphasizing societal changes.​

Each template includes a "transition bar" where participants specify a significant change or event (e.g., "peace process," "regional war") and indicate whether the screenshot is set before, during, or after this transition. 

An AI already analyzed these submissions and extracted a tagline and topics for each submission.

Below is a list of such taglines and topics extracted from a few submissions.
Find the overarching theme that connects these taglines and topics, and return it as a single string - in 3 words (or less) in Hebrew.
Be as specific as possible to the content of the taglines and topics, and avoid generic terms. The best answer will be the one that is an answer to the question "What sort of future change is discussed in most of these submissions?". When answering avoid using the word 'change' in your answer (unless strictly necessary) - just use the word that describes the change. 
For example, if the answer is "changes in political superpowers", just write "political superpowers".
