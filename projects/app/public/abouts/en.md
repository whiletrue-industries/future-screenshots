# About

**Mapfutur.es** is an online map of “future screenshots”—visual glimpses into possible futures, created by participants of workshops, exhibitions, and collaborative sessions. These screenshots are shaped as social media posts, chats, maps, pictures, protest signs, etc. They aren’t predictions, but provocations—designed to expand the scope of our political imagination. Together they offer a way to tap into the wider horizon of futures, one that often hides in the darkness, beyond the blinding spotlight of the bleeding present.

The screenshots in the _Futures Map_ are not organized chronologically, but by relations—spatial, thematic and emotional. With every new submission, the map transforms, revealing new constellations of concern, hope, and contradiction. Instead of telling a linear story, the Futures Map invites you to drift through a living terrain of anticipation and interpretation.

## From Hope to Action

Both [_Future Screenshots_](https://medium.com/@mushon/future-screenshots-cfcf842ad9cf) and the [_Futures Map_](https://mapfutur.es) address a widespread difficulty to see a future. Since October 7th, 2023, it seems like the space for imagination between the river and the sea has been narrowing. Many of the contributors to this archive have lost loved ones, and are still struggling through this barrage of violence. These images of the future are not armchair speculations from the sidelines, they depict true hopes and fears from within the ashes, as the fires still burn. Our political imagination is not an escape; it’s a form of resistance. It’s how we imagine and shape the futures we share—even when doing so may seem preposterous.

These screenshots do not depict complete futures. They’re fragments, peepholes, landmarks in an ocean of uncertainty. Still, when used as a map, they allow us to ask: _what room is there for me in your future?_ This critical question doesn’t stop there. By finding where our imagined futures overlap—and where they collide—we begin to locate opportunities for joint action in the present both towards and against futures that are more than a zero-sum-game. 

## Get Involved

If you’ve created a future screenshot—as part of a class, a protest, a workshop—add it to the Futures Map. This archive is always in progress. It grows with the people who engage it. We also welcome collaborations: co-hosting workshops, developing curriculum, or supporting activist strategies. If you're interested, get in touch. 

We are working to open the map to individual contributions soon.
