# About

**Mapfutur.es** is an online repository of “future screenshots”—visual glimpses into possible futures, created by participants of workshops, exhibitions, and collaborative sessions. These screenshots take the shape of social media posts, chats maps, images, protest signs, etc. They aren’t predictions, but provocations—designed to expand the scope of our political imagination. Together they offer a way to tap into the wider horizon of futures, one that often hides in the darkness, beyond the blinding spotlight of the bleeding present.

The screenshots in the Futures Map are not organized chronologically, but by relations—spatial, thematic and emotional. With every new submission, the map transforms, revealing new constellations of concern, hope, and contradiction. Instead of telling a linear story, the Futures Map invites you to drift through a living terrain of anticipation and interpretation.

## From Hope to Action

Both Future Screenshots and the Futures Map respond to the prevalent inability to see a future after October 7th, 2023. IT seems like the space for imagination  between the river and the sea has been narrowing. Many of the contributors to this archive have lost loved ones, and are still struggling through this barrage of violence. These images of the future are not imagined from the sidelines, but from within the ashes, as the fires still burn. Our political imagination is not an escape; it’s a form of resistance. It’s how we imagine and shape the futures we share—even when doing so feels impossible.

These screenshots do not depict complete futures. They’re fragments, peepholes, landmarks in an ocean of uncertainty. Still, when viewed as a growing field, they allow us to ask: what room is there for me in your future? It’s a critical question, and it doesn’t stop there. By seeing where our visions overlap—and where they collide—we begin to locate opportunities for joint action, mutual prevention in the present towards futures that are more than a zero-sum-game.

## Getting Involved

If you’ve created a future screenshot—as part of a class, a protest, a workshop, or just on your own—add it to the Futures Map. This archive is open and in progress. It grows with the people who engage it. We also welcome collaborations: co-hosting workshops, developing curriculum, or supporting activist strategies. If you're interested, get in touch.
