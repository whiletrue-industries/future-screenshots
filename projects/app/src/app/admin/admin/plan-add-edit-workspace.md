# Allow adding a new workspace

Currently the /admin page allows seeing all existing workspaces but does not allow adding a new one. This feature would be useful for administrators to quickly set up new workspaces without needing to use the command line or other tools.

What needs to be done:
1. Create an admin edit page for editing workspace settings.
2. This page has two modes - one for creating a new workspace, and one for editing an existing workspace.
   2.1 In create mode, the form fields should be empty and ready for new input (and a 'Create' button should be shown).
   2.2 In edit mode, the form fields should be pre-populated with the existing workspace data (and a 'Save' button should be shown). 
3. Add controls in the /admin page:
   - Add a button on the /admin page to navigate to the "Create New Workspace" page. (/admin/new)
   - Add a 'settings' button next to each existing workspace that navigates to the edit page for that workspace. (/admin/edit/{workspaceId}?{key}=adminKey)
4. Implement form validation to ensure that all required fields are filled out correctly when creating a new workspace.
5. Upon successful creation/update, redirect the user back to the /admin page with a success message.

API:
- Create workspace: 
  endpoint POST ${CHRONOMAPS_API_URL}/  +   Authorization: Bearer ${google auth token}
  Request body: The workspace's metadata
  Success Response: 201 Created with the new workspace's data
- Update workspace:
  endpoint PUT ${CHRONOMAPS_API_URL}/{workspaceId} +    Authorization: {workspace admin key}
  Request body: The updated workspace's metadata
  Optional query parameters:
    - public: true/false (to set the workspace's public visibility)
    - collaborate: true/false (to set the if workspace allows new items to be added)
  Success Response: 200 OK with a success message

Authorization:
- 'Admin key' is required to update a workspace.
  This key must be included in the query parameters of the edit page URL when editing an existing workspace.
- 'Google auth token' is required to create a new workspace. This is the same token user for user authentication for the '/admin' page.
  This token must be included in the request headers when creating a new workspace.

Fields for the workspace metadata (and form):
MANDATORY FIELDS:
- 'date': date selection, must be in the form YYYY-MM-DD
- 'city': string
- 'country': string
- 'venue': string
- 'event_name': string
- 'interactive_workshop': boolean
- 'languages': multi-select from list of languages. Save as array of language codes. Valid options are Hebrew (he), Arabic (ar), English (en), Dutch (nl)
   Order of the selected languages matters - the first language is the primary one.
- 'facilitator_names': list of strings (Allow adding multiple names in form)
OPTIONAL FIELDS:
- 'keywords': multi-select from list of keywords. Save as array of strings.
AUTO-GENERATED FIELDS (usually not shown in form):
- 'context-label': Auto generated (not shown in form) as '{City}, {Month Name} {Year}'
- 'source': Auto generated (not shown in form) as '{YYYY}.{MM}.{DD} - {Venue}/{Event Name}'
- 'email-template': Autogenerated (show in form) as 'after-evaluate-{locale}' for non interactive workshops (locale is the 2 letter code of the first selected language), or 'to-evaluate-{locale}' for interactive workshops.

Form must also allow setting the public visibility and collaboration settings of the workspace.
